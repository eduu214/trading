### Updated Implementation Roadmap

```
Completed:
✅ F001-US001: Multi-Market Scanner (100%)
✅ F001-US002: Complexity Optimizer (100%)

New Strategy-First Sequence:
→ F002-US001: Real Strategy Engine (4-6 weeks) ← NEXT
→ F001-US003: Diversification Discovery (2-3 weeks)
→ F003-US001: Portfolio Constructor (3-4 weeks)
→ F002-US002: Execution Safeguards
→ F002-US003: Backtesting-to-Live Bridge
→ F003-US002: Strategy Lifecycle Manager
→ F001-US004: Advanced Filters
→ F001-US005: Multi-factor Risk Analysis
```

### Why This Sequence Change?

The updated FlowPlane documentation has evolved to prioritize **real trading value** over demo functionality:

1. **F002-US001 First**: Creates actual trading strategies with proven indicators
2. **F001-US003 Second**: Analyzes correlation between real strategies (not random price movements)
3. **F003-US001 Third**: Constructs portfolios from validated, profitable strategies

This sequence ensures each component builds on real data and proven strategies rather than demo-level simulations.
