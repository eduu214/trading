# Feature Technical Architecture - F005: Strategy Insight & Research Integration

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Technical Strategy
F005 leverages the established P10 technology stack to transform complex trading strategies into accessible insights. The feature builds upon FastAPI backend services with PostgreSQL persistence, utilizing OpenAI API for natural language generation and Celery for background research processing. This approach ensures strategy explanations integrate seamlessly with the existing system while maintaining the platform's performance standards.

### 1.2 Key Decisions

- **Decision**: OpenAI API for explanation generation over local NLP models
- **Rationale**: Provides superior natural language quality with lower infrastructure complexity for MVP
- **Trade-offs**: External dependency and API costs vs. consistent, high-quality explanations

- **Decision**: Celery-based research aggregation over real-time scraping
- **Rationale**: Respects rate limits, reduces system load, enables scheduled updates
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly delayed research updates vs. system stability and compliance

- **Decision**: PostgreSQL storage for explanations and research over external content management
- **Rationale**: Maintains data consistency, enables fast retrieval, supports offline access
- **Trade-offs**: Storage overhead vs. performance and reliability

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Strategy Explanation Data
Strategy explanations persist in PostgreSQL with structured relationships to strategy definitions and performance metrics. Each explanation maintains versioning for iterative improvement and links to source strategies for consistency validation. The system tracks explanation effectiveness through user interaction metrics and feedback scores.

### 3.2 Research Content Storage
Market research aggregates in PostgreSQL with full-text search capabilities and source attribution. Content maintains freshness timestamps, relevance scoring, and strategy associations. The system supports content archival and retrieval patterns optimized for contextual display.

### 3.3 Performance Context Data
Performance context leverages TimescaleDB extensions for efficient time-series operations. The system maintains rolling calculations for benchmark comparisons, market regime classifications, and attribution analysis. Data relationships support multi-dimensional analysis across strategies, time periods, and market conditions.
