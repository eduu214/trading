# Feature Technical Architecture - F004: Intelligent Validation Framework

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Technical Strategy
The Intelligent Validation Framework leverages PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series validation data, Redis for caching validation rules and results, and Pytest for comprehensive testing orchestration. The framework integrates with Polygon.io for corporate actions data and market structure validation, while utilizing the strategy execution engine's backtesting capabilities for performance validation. Celery manages long-running validation tasks with progress tracking, ensuring validation completes within the one-hour requirement.

### 1.2 Key Decisions
- **Decision**: Asset-specific validation rule engine with pluggable architecture
- **Rationale**: Different asset classes (equities, FX, futures) have unique market structures requiring specialized validation logic
- **Trade-offs**: Increased complexity for comprehensive coverage vs simplified generic validation

- **Decision**: Complexity-adjusted validation periods using parameter count and lookback requirements
- **Rationale**: Complex strategies with more parameters require longer validation to prevent overfitting
- **Trade-offs**: Longer validation times for complex strategies vs uniform validation approach

- **Decision**: Continuous performance monitoring with statistical significance testing
- **Rationale**: Live performance must be monitored against backtesting expectations to catch degradation early
- **Trade-offs**: Real-time monitoring overhead vs periodic batch validation

### 3.2 Strategy Validation History
Time-series data in TimescaleDB tracking validation results, performance metrics, and rule compliance over time. Enables trend analysis and validation rule effectiveness measurement. Links to strategy execution results for comprehensive validation tracking.

### 3.3 Performance Monitoring Data
Real-time performance data comparing live strategy results against validation expectations. Stores statistical test results, variance measurements, and alert triggers. Maintains correlation with market conditions for context-aware validation.
