# Feature Technical Architecture - F001: AI Strategy Discovery Engine

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Technical Strategy
F001 leverages PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series optimization, Redis for high-speed caching, and Celery for distributed processing. The Polygon.io WebSocket API provides real-time market data across US equities, major FX pairs, and CME micro futures. This architecture enables continuous market scanning with sub-minute latency while maintaining 5+ years of historical data for pattern recognition.

### 1.2 Key Decisions
- **Decision**: Use Polygon.io as primary data source with Redis caching layer
- **Rationale**: Polygon.io provides unified API across all asset classes with excellent free tier for development and reasonable production costs
- **Trade-offs**: Single vendor dependency vs simplified integration and cost control

- **Decision**: Implement correlation analysis on strategy returns rather than price movements
- **Rationale**: Strategy return correlation provides true diversification insight for portfolio construction
- **Trade-offs**: Requires 30+ days of strategy execution data vs immediate correlation from price data

- **Decision**: Celery workers specialized by pattern type and asset class
- **Rationale**: Enables parallel processing of different inefficiency detection algorithms
- **Trade-offs**: Higher complexity vs significantly improved throughput for 1000+ symbol scanning

## 2. Shared Component Architecture

### 2.1 Market Data Pipeline (SVC-001)
- **Purpose**: Aggregates and processes real-time market data from Polygon.io across all asset classes
- **Used By**: F001-US001, F001-US004, F004-US001, F005-US003
- **Behaviors**: 
  - Maintains persistent WebSocket connections to Polygon.io for real-time feeds
  - Coordinates data synchronization across US equities, FX pairs, and futures markets
  - Transforms raw market data into normalized format with UTC timestamps using pytz
  - Buffers high-frequency data in Redis for sub-second access
- **Constraints**: Process 1000+ symbols per scan cycle, maintain sub-minute latency for intraday opportunities

### 2.2 Async Task Processor (SVC-004)
- **Purpose**: Manages computationally intensive background tasks for pattern recognition and analysis
- **Used By**: F001-US002, F003-US002, F004-US002, F005-US001
- **Behaviors**:
  - Orchestrates distributed processing across specialized Celery workers
  - Manages task queues for different analysis types (momentum, mean reversion, arbitrage)
  - Coordinates scheduled scanning tasks via Celery Beat
  - Tracks task progress and provides status updates for long-running operations
- **Constraints**: Support 10+ simultaneous complex analysis tasks, sub-minute task scheduling

### 2.3 Strategy Correlation Engine
- **Purpose**: Calculates and monitors correlation between strategy returns for diversification analysis
- **Used By**: F001-US003, F003-US001
- **Behaviors**:
  - Maintains rolling correlation matrices from actual strategy performance data
  - Generates diversification scores on 0-100 scale based on average correlation
  - Triggers alerts when strategy correlation exceeds 0.6 threshold
  - Provides correlation visualization with color-coded matrix (Red >0.7, Yellow 0.3-0.7, Green <0.3)
- **Constraints**: Requires minimum 30 days of strategy returns, updates correlation calculations every 15 minutes during market hours

### 2.4 Pattern Recognition Framework
- **Purpose**: Identifies exploitable market inefficiencies using statistical analysis and complexity optimization
- **Used By**: F001-US002, F001-US005
- **Behaviors**:
  - Detects patterns across multiple timeframes from 1-minute to daily intervals
  - Validates statistical significance of discovered patterns
  - Optimizes strategy complexity by preferring simpler approaches with fewer parameters
  - Filters opportunities by minimum Sharpe ratio threshold of 1.0
- **Constraints**: Maximum 5 input parameters per strategy, focus on statistical arbitrage and mean reversion

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Time-Series Data Management
PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension stores market data with automatic partitioning by time and symbol. Historical data spans 5+ years with minute-level granularity for backtesting. All timestamps stored in UTC with timezone conversion handled by pytz for market hours across different regions.

### 3.2 Real-Time Data Flow
Polygon.io WebSocket streams feed Redis buffers for immediate access. Market data flows through validation and normalization before persistence in PostgreSQL. Corporate actions and reference data from Polygon.io API maintain data integrity across stock splits and dividend adjustments.

### 3.3 Strategy Metadata Storage
Strategy parameters, correlation matrices, and performance metrics persist in PostgreSQL with versioning for audit trails. Pattern recognition results link to underlying market data for validation and explanation generation.
