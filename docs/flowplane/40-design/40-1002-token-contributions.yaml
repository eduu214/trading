recommendations:
  - "Consider adding surface_elevated and primary_light to core semantic tokens"
  - "Evaluate adding component-specific token categories to design system"
  - "Review spacing scale gaps for common layout requirements"
  - "Plan migration path for documented exceptions when library support improves"
