documented_exceptions:
  correlation_color_interpolation:
    value: "linear-gradient between correlation_threshold_low and correlation_threshold_high"
    justification: "Correlation matrix requires smooth color interpolation that cannot be achieved with discrete tokens"
    usage: "correlation_matrix component background gradients only"
    mitigation: "Will implement token-based interpolation when design system supports gradient token arrays"
