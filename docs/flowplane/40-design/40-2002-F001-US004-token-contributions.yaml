    justification: "Correlation matrix requires smooth color gradient that cannot be achieved with discrete tokens"
    usage: "correlation-matrix background gradient only"
    mitigation: "Will implement token-based gradient system when design system supports gradient arrays"

pattern_rationale: "Correlation analysis requires specialized risk-based color coding and matrix-specific sizing that extends beyond general financial status indicators. These patterns are reusable across correlation features in F003 and F004."
