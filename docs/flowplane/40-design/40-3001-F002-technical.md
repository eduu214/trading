# Feature Technical Architecture - F002: Strategy Engine & Execution Bridge

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Technical Strategy
F002 leverages the P10 technology stack to create a robust strategy implementation and execution system. PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB provides optimized storage for backtesting results and strategy parameters, while Redis enables high-performance caching of technical indicators and real-time execution state. The FastAPI backend orchestrates strategy execution using specialized Python libraries (TA-Lib, Vectorbt, PyPortfolioOpt) for financial computations, with Celery managing computationally intensive backtesting tasks. Alpaca's trading API serves as the primary execution venue, providing both paper trading validation and live execution capabilities.

### 1.2 Key Decisions

- **Decision**: Use TA-Lib for technical indicator calculations
- **Rationale**: Industry-standard library with optimized C implementations provides reliable, fast calculations for RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Trade-offs**: Gain proven accuracy and performance vs dependency on external C library

- **Decision**: Implement Vectorbt for backtesting engine
- **Rationale**: Vectorized operations provide 100x performance improvement over loop-based alternatives, essential for testing multiple strategies
- **Trade-offs**: Gain massive performance improvements vs learning curve for vectorized thinking

- **Decision**: Alpaca as primary broker integration
- **Rationale**: Identical API for paper and live trading eliminates transition complexity, commission-free execution reduces costs
- **Trade-offs**: Gain seamless paper-to-live transition vs limited to Alpaca's available instruments

- **Decision**: PyPortfolioOpt for portfolio optimization
- **Rationale**: Modern Portfolio Theory implementation with efficient frontier calculation enables mathematically optimal allocations
- **Trade-offs**: Gain optimal risk-adjusted returns vs computational complexity for large portfolios

## 2. Shared Component Architecture

### 2.1 Technical Indicator Service
- **Purpose**: Calculates standardized technical indicators across all strategies
- **Used By**: F002-US001 (strategy implementation), F003-US001 (portfolio signals)
- **Behaviors**: Maintains indicator calculations using TA-Lib, caches results in Redis for performance, validates input data quality
- **Technology**: TA-Lib with Redis caching layer
- **Constraints**: Sub-second calculation for 100+ symbols, 14-day minimum data requirement for RSI

### 2.2 Backtesting Framework
- **Purpose**: Validates strategy performance using historical data with comprehensive metrics
- **Used By**: F002-US001 (strategy validation), F004-US002 (complexity testing)
- **Behaviors**: Executes vectorized backtests using Vectorbt, calculates Sharpe ratio and drawdown metrics, performs walk-forward analysis
- **Technology**: Vectorbt with PostgreSQL result storage
- **Constraints**: Complete 6-month backtest in under 30 seconds, maintain 70/30 in-sample/out-of-sample split

### 2.3 Strategy Execution Engine
- **Purpose**: Manages live strategy execution with comprehensive safety controls
- **Used By**: F002-US002 (safety checks), F002-US003 (live transition), F003-US002 (portfolio execution)
- **Behaviors**: Validates trade parameters against risk limits, coordinates with Alpaca API for execution, maintains execution audit trail
- **Technology**: FastAPI with Alpaca SDK integration
- **Constraints**: Sub-5-second trade validation, mandatory paper trading validation period

### 2.4 Portfolio Optimization Service
- **Purpose**: Calculates optimal strategy allocations using Modern Portfolio Theory
- **Used By**: F003-US001 (portfolio construction), F003-US002 (rebalancing)
- **Behaviors**: Implements mean-variance optimization using PyPortfolioOpt, generates efficient frontier visualizations, respects allocation constraints
- **Technology**: PyPortfolioOpt with custom constraint handling
- **Constraints**: Complete optimization for 50+ strategies within 30 seconds, maximum 30% single strategy allocation

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Strategy Parameter Storage
Strategy configurations persist in PostgreSQL with versioned parameter sets enabling rollback capabilities. Each strategy maintains parameter history with performance attribution, supporting A/B testing of parameter variations. Relationships track strategy families and parameter inheritance patterns.

### 3.2 Backtesting Results Schema
TimescaleDB optimizes storage of time-series backtest results with automatic partitioning by strategy and date ranges. Performance metrics aggregate at multiple timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly) with pre-calculated Sharpe ratios and drawdown statistics. Correlation matrices between strategies update incrementally as new results arrive.

### 3.3 Execution State Management
Real-time execution state maintains in Redis for sub-second access, with PostgreSQL providing persistent audit trail. Position tracking synchronizes with Alpaca's position API, while order status updates flow through WebSocket connections. Risk limit tracking operates in-memory with periodic persistence.

## 4. Service Layer

- **Technology**: FastAPI with TA-Lib integration
- **Responsibility**: Transforms strategy logic into executable trading rules with technical indicator integration
- **Performance**: Calculate indicators for 1000+ symbols within 5 seconds, support 50+ concurrent strategies

### 4.2 Backtesting Orchestration Service
- **Technology**: Celery with Vectorbt computational engine
- **Responsibility**: Manages distributed backtesting workload with progress tracking and result aggregation
- **Performance**: Process 6-month backtests in under 30 seconds, handle 10+ concurrent backtesting jobs

### 4.3 Risk Management Service

## 5. Integration Architecture

### 5.1 Market Data Integration
Leverages SVC-001 (market_data_pipeline) from infrastructure registry for real-time and historical data feeds. Strategy signals consume standardized data formats with automatic timezone normalization using pytz. Data quality validation ensures indicator calculations receive clean inputs.

### 5.2 External API Integration
Alpaca trading API (EXT-002) provides unified interface for paper and live trading with identical code paths. WebSocket connections maintain real-time position and order status updates. API rate limiting and retry logic handle temporary connectivity issues.

### 5.3 Async Task Processing
Utilizes SVC-004 (async_task_processor) for computationally intensive backtesting operations. Progress tracking enables user interface updates during long-running optimizations. Task prioritization ensures critical live trading operations receive precedence.

### 5.4 Real-Time Communication
Integrates with SVC-005 (real_time_notifications) for execution alerts and performance updates. WebSocket connections deliver trade confirmations and risk limit breaches to user interfaces. Server-sent events provide backtesting progress updates.
