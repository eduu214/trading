### Key Integration Points
- **SVC-002 Integration**: Strategy performance data retrieval and real-time updates
- **SVC-001 Integration**: Benchmark data fetching with market data pipeline
- **DB-001 Usage**: TimescaleDB queries for historical performance analysis
- **Component Reuse**: 88% component reuse rate through P40-10 shared components

### Performance Targets
- Context data retrieval: <3 seconds for complete analysis
- Benchmark comparison calculations: <5 seconds for 1-year period  
- Chart rendering: <1 second for data updates
- Cache performance: 60% response time improvement for repeated requests
- Real-time updates: <30 seconds propagation during market hours

### Validation Criteria
- All UI components use design tokens exclusively
- Performance calculations achieve statistical accuracy requirements
- Error handling covers all identified failure scenarios
- Responsive design works across mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints
- Integration tests validate end-to-end performance context flow
