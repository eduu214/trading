### Detailed Component Testing

#### 1. Backend API Endpoints (7/7 Working)
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/complexity/constraints/` - Create constraint
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/complexity/constraints/{strategy_id}` - Get strategy constraints  
- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/complexity/constraints/{id}` - Delete constraint
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/complexity/constraints/presets/list` - List presets
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/complexity/constraints/presets/{id}/apply` - Apply preset
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/complexity/constraints/multi-timeframe` - Start optimization
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/complexity/constraints/evaluate` - Evaluate constraints

#### 2. Database Models (3/3 Created)
- ✅ `complexity_constraints` - Stores individual constraints
- ✅ `complexity_presets` - Contains system and user presets
- ✅ `multi_timeframe_analysis` - Stores analysis results

#### 3. Service Classes (2/2 Working)
- ✅ `MultiTimeframeOptimizer` - Handles multi-timeframe analysis
- ✅ `ConstraintEvaluator` - Evaluates constraints against metrics

#### 4. Frontend Components (3/3 Created)
- ✅ `TimeframeSelector.tsx` - Interactive timeframe selection with weights
- ✅ `ConstraintBuilder.tsx` - Comprehensive constraint configuration
- ✅ `ComplexityComparisonView.tsx` - Visual comparison and charts

### System Presets Verified
1. **Conservative**: Low risk, stable returns
   - Max Drawdown >= -10%
   - Max Volatility <= 15%
   - Min Sharpe >= 1.0

2. **Balanced** (Default): Moderate risk and return
   - Max Drawdown >= -15%
   - Min Sharpe >= 1.2

3. **Aggressive**: Higher risk for maximum returns
   - Max Drawdown >= -25%
   - Min Sharpe >= 1.5
   - Target Return >= 20%

### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Multi-timeframe complexity scoring with custom weights
- ✅ Hard and soft constraints with importance weighting
- ✅ System preset management with apply functionality
- ✅ Constraint validation and evaluation logic
- ✅ PostgreSQL persistence for all constraint data
- ✅ Visual comparison tools for complexity analysis
- ✅ Async task processing for optimization
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for constraints

### Services Status
- Backend API: ✅ Operational on port 8000
- Frontend: ✅ Accessible on port 3000
- PostgreSQL: ✅ Running with data persisted
- Redis: ✅ Available for caching
- Celery: ✅ Processing async tasks

### Minor Issues Noted
- Evaluate endpoint requires query parameters (not JSON body)
- Status enum values are uppercase in database
- Some response models needed adjustment for async operations

### Conclusion
F001-US002 Slice 2 (Alternative Flows) is fully implemented and operational. All 9 tasks have been completed successfully with comprehensive testing validation. The system supports sophisticated multi-timeframe complexity optimization with custom constraints.

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with:
1. F001-US002 Slice 3: Error Handling (8 tasks)
2. F001-US003: Real-time Performance Tracking
3. Or move to another feature (F002-F006)
